Caen	GSGS (series); 4326. Sheet 29. This sheet was originally published by the Depot de la Guerre in 1839. It was mounted on linen and the gaps along the folds between paper panels show up as horizontal and vertical white lines in this reproduction. These maps were reproduced by the British during WWII in preparation for Operations Overlord and Anvil. Only the sheets covering the northern and southern coasts of France were reproduced. These maps were essential for determining potential locations of airfields, supply depots, road construction materials, and overland transportation routes. The left and right margins contain more information on the geologic formations.
